# FINAL PROJECT - FATE
We are team 10. This is our code for our final project 

## Introduction
We will make a “Choose Your Own Adventure” app, titled "Fate," with short stories that 
allow you to choose your fate in the story by making decisions along the way. Users will 
interact with the app by swiping to the left or right depending on the decision they want 
to make at given points in the story. There will be pictures and text illustrating the
story on the screen. Similar apps include “Episode.”
